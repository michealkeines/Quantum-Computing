Entanglement might not necessarily stirke you as strange, agreement between the values of conventional  bits certainly isnt cause for concern, even if they randomly assume correlated values, in conventional cmputing, if two otherwise reandom bits are alwasy foudn to agree on readout, then there are two entirely unremarkable possibilites

1. some mecahnism in the pas thas coeced therir values to be equal giving them common cause, if this is the case their randomness is actually illusory
2. the two bits truly assume random values at the very moment of readout, but they are able to communicate to ensure their values correlate.

yet, john bell, conclusivly demostrated that entanglement allows such agreement wihout either of these two reasonable explanations being responsible.

this is the sense in which you may hear it said that entagleent is a kind of distinctly quantum link between qubits that is stronger than could ever be conventionally possible.


Fidelity:
measure of the difference between two register states known as the fidelity.

it mathematically encapsulated a way of comparing two superpositions.
